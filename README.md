# SuperAwesome Library React
This small package houses React component outputed from the superawesomewc component library, which is built using StencilJS. 
Because react doesn't play nice with custom elements, particuarly with non-scalar data (data formats which aren't text or numbers), superawesomewc 
uses the @stencil/react-output-target package to create react components and puts them here.

## Intallation

```bash
yarn add sa-library-react
```
